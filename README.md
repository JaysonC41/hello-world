# hello-world
this repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow

My name is Jayson, I am 41 years old and I am currently living in Louisville KY. I have had some programming experience before, but it has been years. I am taking this class to brush up on my skills and to develop new skills to help me be successful. I am a very goal driven person and I am very organized. I am looking forward to taking these classes and learning new skills.
